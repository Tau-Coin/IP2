# IP2
 Internet Protocol 2 uses self-generated 256 bits public key as address, while previous Internet Protocol RFC 791 uses hierarchically assigned address ether IPv4 or IPv6 to communicate. IP2 is designed for restriction free "public key to public key" overlay communication on UDP. IP2 is not easily affacted by network devices such as router, firewall and NAT.
